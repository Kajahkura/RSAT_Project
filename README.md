RSAT - Remote Security Audit ToolRSAT is a lightweight, cross-platform security assessment instrument designed for consultants and IT professionals. It executes a "one-shot" audit of a client endpoint—detecting encryption status, network vulnerabilities, and hygiene issues—without requiring installation or pre-existing dependencies.The tool compiles into a standalone zero-dependency binary that generates a professional, self-contained HTML report in seconds.🚀 Key FeaturesRSAT interrogates the native OS kernel and subsystems to provide a definitive "source of truth" audit:Security DomainWindows ChecksmacOS Checks🔐 Disk EncryptionVerifies BitLocker status, protection level, and suspension states (via PowerShell/manage-bde).Verifies FileVault 2 status and encryption progress (via fdesetup).🛡️ Network DefenseAudits Windows Defender Firewall profiles (Domain, Private, Public).Audits Application Firewall (ALF) state and Stealth Mode configuration.📡 Port ScanningMulti-threaded scan of high-risk ports: 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 139, 445, 3389, 5900, 8080. Only reports Open/Exposed ports.Same architecture using BSD Sockets.🩹 System HygieneChecks Registry for Pending Reboot flags (Windows Update/Component Based Servicing).Checks SoftwareUpdate.plist for pending recommended updates.📊 ReportingGenerates a locally saved Audit_Report_[Hostname].html with embedded CSS and logic-based color coding (Pass/Fail/Warn).Same structure.🏗️ Technical ArchitectureRSAT is engineered with a Zero-Dependency philosophy. It avoids heavy third-party libraries that bloat binary size or introduce supply chain risks.1. Hybrid Execution ModelThe tool uses Python for control logic but outsources data gathering to native OS binaries. This ensures the audit relies on the OS's own "Source of Truth" rather than potentially outdated Python wrappers.Windows: Uses ctypes to call Win32 APIs and subprocess to invoke PowerShell/manage-bde.macOS: Uses plistlib to parse system preferences and subprocess to invoke fdesetup/socketfilterfw.2. Autonomous Privilege EscalationSecurity auditing requires administrative access. RSAT implements a self-elevation mechanism:Windows: Detects privileges via shell32.IsUserAnAdmin(). If false, it re-launches itself using ShellExecuteW with the runas verb to trigger the UAC prompt.macOS: Detects root via os.getuid(). If false, it re-launches via os.execvp using sudo, prompting the user for their password in the terminal.3. Cross-Platform CompilationThe build system utilizes PyInstaller to bundle the Python interpreter and script into a single executable file (.exe for Windows, Mach-O binary for macOS). This eliminates the need for the client to have Python installed.📥 Usage (For Clients)No Python knowledge or installation is required.Navigate to the [suspicious link removed] page of this repository.Download the binary for your system:Windows: AuditTool_Windows.exemacOS: AuditTool_macOSRun with Privileges:Windows: Right-click the file and select "Run as Administrator".macOS: Open your terminal, navigate to the download folder, and run sudo ./AuditTool_macOS.Note: Administrative privileges are strictly required to query BitLocker keys, Firewall profiles, and Global System Updates.The tool will auto-generate an HTML report in the same folder.🛠️ Development & Build SetupTo contribute or build the binary locally, follow these steps.1. Clone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/Kajahkura/RSAT_Project.git](https://github.com/Kajahkura/RSAT_Project.git)
cd RSAT_Project
2. Set up Virtual Environmentpython -m venv venv

# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install DependenciesThe tool relies on the Python Standard Library (os, sys, socket, subprocess, ctypes) for logic. The only external dependency is PyInstaller for the build process.pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run from Sourcepython src/audit_tool.py
5. Build Binary LocallyTo create the standalone executable (frozen binary):pyinstaller --onefile --console --clean --name AuditTool_Local src/audit_tool.py
The executable will appear in the dist/ folder.⚙️ CI/CD PipelineThis project utilizes GitHub Actions for automated cross-platform compilation.Workflow File: .github/workflows/build.ymlTrigger: The build pipeline runs automatically when a new tag (e.g., v1.0.0) is pushed.Matrix Strategy: Builds simultaneously on windows-latest and macos-latest runners to ensure native binary compatibility.⚠️ DisclaimerThis tool is for authorized security auditing purposes only.Port scanning and security enumeration without permission may be illegal in certain jurisdictions.
